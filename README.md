# ChatBot

I built a small project demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in practice including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Designed for learning and understanding OOP fundamentals through a simple implementation.

Steps to build and execute the project

1. Create python environment using command: python -m venv venv.

2. Activate the environment using the command: venv\Scripts\activate.

3. Create a new file requirements.txt in which we install all the required libraries
   -Streamlit
   -groq
   -python-dotenv.

4. Run this command to install above things: pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Create all the required folders and files (Folders:Chatbot,tutors Files:**init.py**,engine.py,app.py,config.py).

6. In config.py file set (Model,Tokens etc..)

7. In .env file set API_KEY

8. Write the required code in app.py and engine.py etc..

9. Run application using command: streamlit run app.py

   You will get the output....
